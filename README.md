WELCOME TO SVG Animations Project!

This project was build to learn about SVG and how can I animate every part of it. I decided to include three different animations. The first one using GSAP Library and the two others using just CSS.

To navigate through the project there is button at the lower left side of the screen that will take you from one animation to the other thanks to React Router.

The SVGs used in this project for the sushi and phone animations were made by me with Figma and the last Gym SVG was downloaded from the web.
